SQL BMI Case Study (SQLBolt Lesson 3)

This repository contains a simple SQL practice project based on SQLBolt – Lesson 3: Sorting Query Results, using a health dataset to analyze Body Mass Index (BMI).

Description

This project demonstrates how to sort and prioritize query results using SQL clauses such as ORDER BY, ASC, DESC, LIMIT, and OFFSET.
The data includes height, weight, age, gender, and calculated BMI, which are used to identify ranked and priority BMI records.

ORDER BY for sorting query results

ASC and DESC for ascending and descending order

LIMIT to restrict the number of returned rows

OFFSET to skip specific rows

Sorting using multiple columns

Features

Calculate BMI using SQL formula

Sort BMI data (highest to lowest, lowest to highest)

Retrieve top and ranked BMI records

Combine filtering and sorting for analysis

Tools

SQL
